->streams are wrappers around data sources, allowing us to operate with that data source and

TryStreams1 - creating streams using different methods
TryStreams2 - sample operations
forEach
map and collect
stream and collect
filter and collect
toArray
flatMap

a stream pipeline usually consists of a source of stream, zero or more intermediate operations and
a terminal operation
